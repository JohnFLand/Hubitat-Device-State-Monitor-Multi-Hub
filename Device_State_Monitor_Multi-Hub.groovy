/*
Device State Monitor Multi-Hub

PURPOSE: Report device states across up to three Hubitat hubs, with clickable
         State cells to turn switch devices ON or OFF instantly. Also reports
         devices that are OFFLINE, INACTIVE, NOT PRESENT, DISCONNECTED
         (e.g. MQTT Display Publisher), or whose last activity exceeds a
         configurable time threshold, plus RM/BC rules whose Private Boolean
         is currently FALSE.

FEATURES:
    * Hub #1 devices queried locally. Separate ON-monitor, OFF-monitor, and
      Health/Activity-monitor device pickers. The health picker uses Load /
      Select All / Clear All (via Hub #1 Maker API) when credentials are
      configured; falls back to a capability picker otherwise.
    * Hubs #2 & #3 queried via Maker API. Connection credentials are collapsible
      once configured.
    * Clickable State cells in ON/OFF tables replace the old Action column: click
      "ON" to turn a device off, click "OFF" to turn it on. Unknown-state devices
      show → ON / → OFF mini-buttons embedded directly in the State cell.
      The Action column has been removed from all switch tables.
    * Toggle commands for Hub #1 use a separate optional Maker API credential block.
      Toggle commands for Hubs #2 & #3 reuse their existing Maker API credentials.
    * Optional Unknown State table catches devices reporting neither on nor off.
    * Health / Activity Monitor table shows any selected device that is OFFLINE,
      INACTIVE, NOT PRESENT, DISCONNECTED (connectionStatus attribute),
      or has last activity older than X hours (configurable).
    * Each hub has its own Health/Activity device selector. Remote hubs expose ALL
      Maker API devices (not just switch-capable) in the health selector.
    * Optional toggle to exclude virtual devices from all reports, including the
      Health/Activity table (uses same "virtual" definition as other tables).
    * All tables are independently sortable (click headers or Sort Options).
    * Health / Activity Monitor table is horizontally scrollable on narrow screens
      so iPhone portrait views do not squeeze columns until cells overlap.
    * Private Boolean FALSE table scans RM/BC child rules across Hub #1 and
      enabled Hubs #2/#3, lists only FALSE rules, and keeps unreadable rules
      as unknown instead of incorrectly treating them as FALSE. FALSE state
      cells are clickable to set that rule's Private Boolean TRUE: Hub #1
      directly via RMUtils, Hubs #2/#3 relayed to Private Boolean Manager's
      /setPB endpoint on that hub (requires PBM installed there plus its app
      ID and access token in this app's PB table settings). A changed row
      stays listed until the next PB scan and can be clicked back to FALSE.
    * Device names link to their hub's Devices page; PB rule names link to the
      corresponding rule configuration page.
    * Report tables and Refresh button appear at the TOP of the page;
      all configuration sections are collapsed below.
    * Refresh Table button re-queries all hubs on demand.
    * Graceful error handling if a remote hub is offline or unreachable.
    * Only switch-capable devices appear in ON/OFF/Unknown selection lists.
    * Remote hub action dropdowns leave their section open after action.
    * Each Device Selection section shows one reminder + a direct "Open
      Maker API" link button so newly added hub devices aren't missed: a
      device must be exposed in Maker API on its hub BEFORE it can appear
      in any picker here, even after Load/Reload.

CHANGES IN 1.54:
    * All Maker API calls now go through a hardened fetchJson() helper that
      retrieves the response as raw text and parses JSON manually, and reports
      the HTTP status plus the start of any non-JSON response body instead of
      a cryptic "Lexing failed ... reading '<'" JSON lexer error.

CHANGES IN 1.55:
    * fetchJson() now splits the ?access_token=... query string out of the URI
      and passes it via the query: map. Works around the platform 2.5.1.x
      (Apache HttpClient 5.6.1) regression where a query string embedded in
      the uri is silently dropped on the wire, causing remote Maker API calls
      to arrive unauthenticated. Compatible with 2.5.0.x and earlier as well.

CHANGES IN 1.56:
    * NEW: Contact Sensor table. Each hub has its own contact sensor selector
      (Hub #1 via capability picker; Hubs #2/#3 via Maker API device list —
      run Load / Reload Device List once after upgrading to populate them).
      By default the table lists only sensors currently OPEN ("N open of M
      monitored"); a display option switches it to show every selected sensor.
    * FIX: HSM Alert now clears when a custom-rule alert is cancelled. HSM
      cancels rule alerts with hsmAlert value "cancelRuleAlerts", not "cancel";
      the old handler only recognized "cancel", so a CUSTOM RULE alert stayed
      on screen forever after HSM itself had cleared it. Both cancel values
      are now honored, transient "arming*" notices are no longer latched as
      alerts, and rule alerts now display the rule name and start time.
    * NEW: "Clear HSM Alert Display" button appears next to Refresh whenever
      an alert is latched, as a manual escape hatch if a cancel event is ever
      missed (e.g. hub reboot mid-alert, or an alert stuck from v1.55).
    * FIX: HSM Status label. hsmStatus "disarmed" only means INTRUSION is
      disarmed — smoke/water/custom monitoring stays armed until All
      Monitoring is disarmed (hsmStatus "allDisarmed"). The badge now reads
      "Intrusion Disarmed" with a note that smoke/water/custom rules remain
      armed, matching the hub UI's "Armed Smoke/Water" wording.

CHANGES IN 1.57:
    * NEW: HSM alert verification on every refresh. HSM reports alerts to
      other apps ONLY via hsmAlert location events — there is no query API —
      so a single missed event (code update race, app reinstall, hub reboot
      mid-alert) left the badge permanently wrong. The app now also polls the
      hub itself at refresh time: if the HSM app ID is configured (the number
      in HSM's URL, e.g. /installedapp/configure/2), it reads the HSM app
      page directly and extracts the live alert text (e.g. "Custom Rule
      Alert: Door Locks unlocked"); otherwise it scans the local Apps list
      for the red "ALERT!" suffix HSM adds to its own app label. Either way,
      the badge is reconciled with reality on every Refresh Table click —
      missed alert events are detected and displayed, and stale alerts are
      auto-cleared. Requires Hub Login Security to be OFF on Hub #1 (or the
      badge shows a note that verification is unavailable and falls back to
      event-only behavior). Verification can be disabled in Sort & Display
      Options.

CHANGES IN 1.58:
    * NEW: HSM status and alert display for Hubs #2 and #3 (off by default;
      enable per hub in Sort & Display Options).
      - STATUS comes from each hub's Maker API HSM endpoint
        (/apps/api/<id>/hsm) using the credentials already configured for
        that hub. Requires the HSM toggle to be enabled inside that hub's
        Maker API app ("Allow control of HSM"); until it is, the badge shows
        Unavailable with a hint.
      - ALERTS use the same page-verification technique introduced in 1.57,
        pointed at the remote hub's IP: with the remote HSM app ID
        configured, the live alert text is read from that hub's HSM app
        page; otherwise the remote Apps list is scanned for the "ALERT!"
        label suffix. Requires Hub Login Security OFF on the remote hub.
      - Remote hubs have no event path (location events do not cross hubs),
        so remote alert state is poll-only and updates on each refresh —
        which is when the report updates anyway.
    * When any remote HSM badge is enabled, all HSM lines are labeled with
      their hub's friendly name to keep them distinguishable.
    * Internal: pollHsmAlertFromHub() generalized to pollHsmAlertFromHost()
      so Hub #1 and remote hubs share the same verification code path.

CHANGES IN 1.59:
    * FIX: The "Clear HSM Alert Display" button lagged one refresh behind the
      alert badge. The button's visibility check ran BEFORE the report was
      generated, but the report generation is where the 1.57 verification
      poll runs — so an alert latched (or auto-cleared) by the poll itself
      updated the badge on that refresh while the button only caught up on
      the next one. The report is now generated first and the button check
      evaluated afterward, so the button and badge always agree within the
      same refresh. (Note: as with all Hubitat app pages, the page itself
      only updates on a render — clicking Refresh Table or reopening the
      app — never spontaneously while it sits open.)

CHANGES IN 1.60:
    * NEW: Rules with Private Boolean FALSE table immediately after the
      Health / Activity Monitor. Scans Rule Machine and Button Controller
      child rules on Hub #1 and on enabled Hubs #2/#3, and lists only rules
      whose current Private Boolean is FALSE. Columns: Rule, App Type, Hub,
      and Last Run; the table is independently sortable and can be filtered by hub.
    * PB-state logic follows Private Boolean Manager 1.52: a successful,
      structurally valid statusJson read with no "private" appState entry is
      treated as FALSE (Rule Machine's default), while HTTP / parse / malformed
      payload failures remain unknown and are never incorrectly listed as FALSE.
    * PB scanning runs asynchronously with a six-minute watchdog, so hundreds
      of rules do not hold the app page open. Existing
      PB results remain visible while a new PB scan is running. Remote PB
      scanning uses each enabled hub's configured IP and Hubitat internal
      app/status pages; Hub Login Security must allow those pages to be read.

CHANGES IN 1.61:
    * FIX: PB FALSE scan results were silently destroyed whenever the async
      scan chain finished while a page render was still in flight. Hubitat
      loads an app's entire state map at the start of each execution and
      writes the whole map back at the end, so a mainPage render that began
      before finalizePbFalseScan() committed would overwrite pbFalseRowsJson
      (and every other PB state key) with its stale pre-scan snapshot. The
      page then saw rowsJson == null with no active scan, auto-restarted the
      scan, and the ~6-second render again outlived the fast localhost scan —
      an endless "PB scan in progress… / No rules." loop. (Private Boolean
      Manager never hit this because its page render is cheap and its scans
      take minutes, so a render commit never landed after scan finalize.)
    * Scan results are now ALSO stored in a @Field static map
      (pbFinalizedResults), which is immune to state-snapshot overwrites.
      Every mainPage render read-repairs state from that map before deciding
      whether a scan is needed, so a clobbered state commit self-heals on the
      next render/poll instead of triggering a rescan.
    * Discovery warnings are carried in the finalized-results map as well, so
      they survive regardless of which execution's state commit wins.

CHANGES IN 1.62:
    * FIX: formatPbScanDuration() crashed with "Ambiguous method overloading
      for method java.lang.Math#max ... [Long, BigDecimal]" at the end of
      EVERY scan. Groovy's '/' on two longs returns a BigDecimal, and
      Math.max(Long, BigDecimal) has no unambiguous overload. Because the
      crash happened inside finalizePbFalseScan() (called from the last
      status callback and from the watchdog), results were never written and
      pbCurrentScanId was never cleared — the table stayed at "PB scan in
      progress… / No rules." forever and all restart attempts were ignored
      as duplicate starts. Now uses intdiv() (pure long math). This was the
      primary cause of the missing table in 1.60/1.61; the state-snapshot
      race fixed in 1.61 was a secondary hazard.
    * HARDENING: finalizePbFalseScan() now clears the transient scan statics
      in a finally block and surfaces any finalize exception via
      pbFalseLastError, so no future finalize failure can wedge the scan in
      a permanent "in progress" state.

CHANGES IN 1.63:
    * NEW: Added a PB State column to the Rules with Private Boolean FALSE
      table. Hub #1 FALSE cells are clickable; clicking FALSE uses the
      documented Rule Machine RMUtils action setRuleBooleanTrue (RM 5.0),
      briefly shows TRUE, then removes the row because it no longer belongs
      in the FALSE-only table. The cached finalized PB result is updated at
      the same time so the row stays gone on a normal page refresh.
    * PB toggling is deliberately limited to Hub #1. RMUtils acts on Rule
      Machine on the hub running this app and has no remote-hub target
      parameter. Remote Hub #2/#3 rows therefore show their actual FALSE
      state but are non-clickable, avoiding any chance of changing a local
      rule that happens to have the same numeric app ID.
    * PB state clicks are disabled while a PB scan is active to avoid a
      completed scan racing a user change and reintroducing stale FALSE rows.
    * Added a small self-enabling OAuth endpoint, following Private Boolean
      Manager 1.52, so the in-table browser click can safely call back into
      this app and invoke RMUtils on Hub #1.

CHANGES IN 1.64:
    * FIX: PB table rule names no longer display Hubitat's embedded color-span
      markup as literal HTML text (for example, <span style='color:red'>...
      </span>). Rule names are now fully HTML-escaped first, then only the
      tightly restricted color-span pattern already used by Private Boolean
      Manager is restored for display. This preserves Hubitat status suffixes
      such as "(Required Expression false)" as colored text without allowing
      arbitrary rule-name HTML to be injected into the report. Existing cached
      PB rows render correctly immediately; no PB rescan is required.

CHANGES IN 1.65:
    * NEW: Replaced the single PB FALSE table visibility control with three
      per-hub controls: "Show Rules with Private Boolean FALSE table for Hub 1",
      Hub 2, and Hub 3. The single PB table now filters its cached rows to the
      selected hub(s). PB scanning still collects all configured/enabled hubs,
      so changing only the display controls does not require a rescan.
    * Legacy showPbFalseTable is used as a fallback only until each new per-hub
      setting is saved, preserving the prior visibility choice on upgrade.

CHANGES IN 1.66:
    * CHANGED: The three per-hub PB FALSE controls now select which hubs are
      actually scanned, not merely which cached rows are displayed. Hub #1 is
      discovered/scanned only when its PB control is enabled. Hubs #2/#3 are
      discovered/scanned only when both their PB control and the hub itself are
      enabled. Unselected hubs receive no Apps-list discovery request and no
      per-rule statusJson requests, avoiding PB work on hubs that are not selected.
    * The combined PB FALSE table still filters cached rows by the same controls,
      so disabling a hub hides its old cached rows immediately; the next PB scan
      replaces the cache with results from only the selected hubs.

CHANGES IN 1.67-1.70: Internal concurrency experiments, superseded by 1.71.

CHANGES IN 1.71:
    * Current PB state is read strictly one rule at a time across all selected
      hubs. An unreadable rule is retried up to three attempts; if it is still
      unreadable, it is published as UNKNOWN with its linked rule name available
      for manual inspection, and known FALSE results from the same completed
      scan remain available.
    * The per-hub PB scan selectors, clickable Hub #1 FALSE-to-TRUE state cells,
      safe rule-name HTML rendering, clobber-resistant finalized-result cache, and
      FALSE/UNKNOWN table behavior are unchanged.

CHANGES IN 1.72:
    * CLEANUP: Removed dead code left over from earlier scan designs: the
      write-only state.pbFalseScanTotal key (also removed from existing installs
      on the next Done), the unused findPbRuleBaseUrl() helper and the baseUrl
      entry it populated, the duplicate pbScanSequentialQueue static (the scan
      uses one rule queue), and the vestigial pbScanPhase static and its guards
      (pbCurrentScanId alone identifies an active scan).
    * RENAMED for clarity: PB_STATUS_PUMP_INTERVAL_SECS is now
      PB_STATUS_WATCHDOG_INTERVAL_SECS, PB_STATUS_VERIFY_MAX_ATTEMPTS is now
      PB_STATUS_READ_MAX_ATTEMPTS, and finishPbVerifiedScan() is now
      finishPbSequentialScan().
    * FIX: FALSE cells in the PB table are now red (both clickable Hub #1 cells
      and read-only remote-hub cells); previously both rendered in gray.
    * FIX: In setPbFalseToTrue(), the click-busy flag was set before the
      missing-URL guard, so an early return could permanently block all further
      PB State clicks until a page reload. The guard now runs first.
    * The zero-rules path and finalize now publish results through one shared
      writer (publishPbFinalizedResults) so the two cannot drift apart, and
      buildPbFalseTable() reads cached rows through getCachedPbFalseRows(),
      which prefers the clobber-proof static copy.
    * Legacy showPbFalseTable is migrated once to the per-hub PB controls
      (any unset per-hub toggle inherits the legacy value) and the legacy
      setting is then removed; the runtime fallback is gone.
    * Removed a JSON-parse branch in buildPbScanResultFromResponse() that could
      only ever throw (non-JSON, non-login-page payloads are now logged directly).

CHANGES IN 1.73:
    * NEW: Hub #2/#3 FALSE PB State cells are now clickable, using the Private
      Boolean Manager 1.52 already installed on those hubs. Enter each remote
      hub's PBM app ID and OAuth access token in the PB table settings (the
      instructions beside the inputs explain where to find both). A click on a
      remote FALSE cell calls this app's /setPbTrue endpoint as before; the app
      then relays the request server-side from Hub #1 to PBM's documented
      /setPB endpoint on that hub, which invokes RMUtils locally there and
      also updates PBM's own cached PB states.
    * The relay is synchronous and verified: the table row is removed and the
      cached FALSE count decremented only after the remote PBM responds with
      status success. Transport errors, HTTP errors, bad credentials, and
      PBM-reported failures all surface in the browser alert and the log, and
      the row remains in place.
    * Remote hubs without PBM credentials configured keep read-only FALSE
      cells, with a tooltip explaining how to enable click-to-set. All other
      guards are unchanged and now hub-aware: clicks are rejected while a PB
      scan is running or another PB change is in flight, and only rules
      currently cached as FALSE for that specific hub can be changed.

CHANGES IN 1.74:
    * CHANGED: Clicking a FALSE PB State cell no longer removes the row.
      The cell changes to a blue clickable TRUE and the row remains listed
      until the next PB scan (manual, automatic, or after Done) rebuilds the
      table from fresh results.
    * NEW: Change-of-mind support — clicking a TRUE cell sets that rule's
      Private Boolean back FALSE (Hub #1 via RMUtils, remote hubs relayed to
      PBM's /setPB, which accepts both values). Setting FALSE is deliberately
      restricted to rows this table itself set TRUE: the endpoint requires the
      rule to be cached with the opposite state before acting, so arbitrary
      rules can never be driven FALSE from here.
    * The /setPbTrue endpoint is now /setPb with a value=true|false parameter;
      removeCachedPbFalseRule() is replaced by updateCachedPbFalseRow(), which
      updates the cached row's PB state in place and recomputes the live FALSE
      count (the count header still counts only FALSE rows). A footnote below
      the table notes when changed rows are being retained.
    * NOTE: A successful relayed click is silent in the remote PBM's log by
      design — PBM logs setPB actions only when its debug logging is enabled.

CHANGES IN 1.75:
    * FIX (latent since the health feature was added): getDeviceById() does
      not exist in the Hubitat app sandbox, so the two call sites that used it
      threw MissingMethodException on every call — the parent-lastActivity
      fallback for Hub #1 child devices, and the supplementary
      hub1SelectedHealthDevices resolution — and both silently did nothing.
      Both now work through Hub #1's OWN Maker API: parents are fetched for
      their lastActivity, and supplementary health IDs are checked via the
      same code path used for Hubs #2/#3 (with links rewritten to relative
      URLs). Requires the Hub #1 Maker API app ID and token already used for
      Hub #1 toggle links; without them the supplementary IDs are skipped
      with one info log instead of one debug error per device.
    * FIX: A literal null entry in a Maker API /devices list (typically a
      deleted device still selected in that Maker API app) aborted the whole
      hub's switch/health query with "Cannot get property 'id' on null
      object". fetchJson() now drops null list entries centrally, logs how
      many were skipped, and advises re-saving that hub's Maker API app.
    * HARDENING: The per-device health check now has a circuit breaker — three
      consecutive failures with no successes marks the hub's Maker API as not
      responding and skips the remaining checks, replacing the previous
      one-warning-per-device cascade (19+ log lines per hub) with a single
      actionable warning.
    * The empty-response error message now names the endpoint and explains the
      browser test and the fix (re-open that Maker API app and press Done, or
      reboot that hub).

CHANGES IN 1.76:
    * HARDENING against a broken Maker API (observed with a 2026-07-07 beta
      platform build that returned device lists of the correct length with
      every element serialized as literal null, and empty bodies for
      single-object endpoints): a device list with zero usable entries is no
      longer treated as authoritative. Previously the health check interpreted
      it as "every selected device is disabled or removed" and silently
      skipped them all — rendering a clean health table during a total data
      outage, the worst possible failure mode for a monitoring app.
    * All four remote fetchers (switch states, locks, contacts,
      health/activity) now stop and surface a visible per-hub warning when the
      Maker API returns no usable device data, naming the likely cause
      (a recent platform/beta update) instead of producing empty-but-clean
      tables. The device-picker loaders likewise report the condition in
      their status line and log instead of quietly loading zero devices.
    * No behavior changes when the Maker API is healthy: a genuinely empty
      selection still reports normally, and hubs with working APIs are
      unaffected.

CHANGES IN 1.77:
    * ROOT CAUSE FOUND AND FIXED for the 2026-07-07 outage: it was never the
      responding hubs' Maker APIs — it was the HTTP CLIENT on the hub running
      this app. The beta platform build hands resp.data back to httpGet
      callers ALREADY PARSED (a Map or List) for application/json responses,
      regardless of the requested contentType. This app's text-fallback
      (d.text) silently mangled parsed data: on a Map, .text is a missing key
      → null → the "empty response (HTTP 200)" errors on every single-object
      endpoint (/devices/<id>, /hsm, statusJson); on a List, Groovy
      spread-collects a nonexistent 'text' property from each element → a
      list of N nulls whose toString is "[null, null, …]" — valid JSON that
      re-parsed into the all-null device lists with exactly-correct lengths.
      This also explains why the non-beta Office hub "failed" identically
      (the beta House hub was the client mangling its responses) and why a
      browser showed correct JSON from a beta Garage hub (the server side was
      always fine).
    * fetchJson() now accepts pre-parsed Map/List responses directly, and
      fetchRawText() re-serializes them to JSON text for its text-parsing
      callers. Both helpers remain fully compatible with the pre-beta
      behavior (String/Reader bodies), so this version works on either
      firmware — rolling back is no longer required for this app, though the
      1.76 no-usable-data guards remain as defense in depth.
    * HTML endpoints (e.g. the HSM app page verification) were never affected,
      which is why they kept working throughout — the beta change applies
      only to application/json responses.
